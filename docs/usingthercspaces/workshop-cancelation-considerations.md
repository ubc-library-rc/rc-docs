### Things to consider when canceling a workshop:
- **Cancelation message:** Be sure to send-out a short cancelation message to all workshop registrants.
    - To access the 'Email Attendees' tab, from the LibCal Home screen: click 'Events' in the top menu bar > click 'UBC Vancouver Library Public Events' in the 'Calendar List' > click the relevant workshop on the applicable day > click the blue 'Manage Event' button in the pop-up box > click the 'Email Attendees' tab.
    - Click the 'Add Registered' button to add workshop participants to the email.
    - In the 'Subject' header, include the following:
        - Cancelation notice
        - Workshop name
        - Workshop date
        - Example: 'CANCELED: Introduction to Git and GitHub, 23 Sep 2021'
    - Include a short message in the body of the email.
        - Example: "Due to unforeseen circumstances, the 'Introduction to Git and GitHub' workshop on 23 Sep 2021 has been canceled. We apologize for the inconvenience."
        - *NOTE:* If you will be rescheduling the workshop, include a note in the message, along with the date and a link to register.
            - Participants will have to re-register for the rescheduled workshop, as there does not appear to be an easy way in LibCal to upload registrants from the canceled event into the rescheduled event.
    - Click the 'Send Email' button when the email is complete.
- **Adding notice to workshop title:** You may find it beneficial to add a notice to the workshop title in LibCal. This may provide more clarity for workshop registrants than removing the event from the calendar.
    - Example: 'CANCELED: Introduction to Git and GitHub'
    - From the workshop 'Calendar' page, click the relevant workshop on the applicable date, click the 'Modify Event' button in the lower-right, add 'CANCELED: ' to the 'Event Title' field, click the 'Submit: Update Event!' button at the bottom of the page.
    - *NOTE:* Ensure the 'CANCELED: ' prefix in the title field is removed before duplicating an event.
