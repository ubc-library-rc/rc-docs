## Patron feedback survey

The Research Commons uses a generic feedback form for all workshops and consultations.
The feedback link is different for each workshop and consists of a base URL (always the same) followed by three parameters with context-specific information:

`https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0MtLRW33U8lIp8x?title=NVivo2&presenter=amir_jeremy&date=2021-10-06`

<br/>

| **Base URL** | <https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0MtLRW33U8lIp8x>
| **Title of workshop** | title=NVivo2 *(use `title=consult` for consultations)*
| **Presenter names** | presenter=amir_jeremy
| **Date** | date=2021-10-06 *(leave blank for consultations)*

{: .note}
When creating links don't forget the `?` after the base URL and the `&` between each of the parameters 

## Sample feedback URLs
**For workshops:** link for a Zotero workshop presented by Elham and Reza on October 15, 2020:

`https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0MtLRW33U8lIp8x?title=zotero&presenter=elham_reza&date=2020-10-15`

**For consultations:** links are similar but do not include the date parameter so they can be added to the LibCal follow-up email for all of a GAA's consults. Here's an example for a consultation by Albina:

`https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0MtLRW33U8lIp8x?title=consult&presenter=albina`

## When to share the feedback URL
**For workshops:** recommended practice is to leave a few minutes free at the end of the workshop, to share the link in the chat, and to ask participants to submit feedback at that time. The response rate is much higher than if the feedback link is only provided in the follow-up email.
