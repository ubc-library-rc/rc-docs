Recording activities in Desk Tracker
============================

UBC Library uses Desk Tracker software to record consultations and
instruction activity at all branches. Records are compiled for annual
statistical surveys and may be used by branches/units in planning and
assessment.

**GAA's are responsible** for entering data about their consultations and workshops.

### Activity form
Use the _Activity_ form to record information about your consultations. Do not record no-shows.

-   **Contact method**. Refers to the actual consultation. Use _Walk in_ for in-person consultations.
-   **Type**. Some consultations may fit more than on type; choose the _best fit_.
-   **Time (minutes)**. This can be an estimate.
-   **What is the question? Comments?**. A short phrase or two is enough. The purpose is to provide a broad overview of the type of questions, projects and topics we supported.

### Classes form
Use the _Classes_ form to record information about your workshops. Only the _required_ fields need to be completed. Each workshop should be entered only once (if co-presenting, agree on who will enter the data).

-   **Primary audience**. If unknown, choose _Multiple_. You do not need to specify in the comments.
-   **Primary academic faculty (UBCV)**. If unknown, choose _Multiple faculties_. You do not need to specify which faculties in the comments.


Reports
-------

Everyone with Desk Tracker access can generate reports and export data in .csv
format from the *Reports* tab. For the
most flexible output download as .csv using the *Data File Generator*
link.
