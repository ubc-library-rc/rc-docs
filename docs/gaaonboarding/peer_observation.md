# Peer observation of instruction 
GAAs lead or co-facilitate many of the workshops offered by the UBC Library Research Commons (RC). The RC is committed to improving its workshops and to helping GAAs develop their instruction and facilitation skills. The _peer observation of instruction_ program is one way to provide a mutually beneficial learning experience for GAAs. 

## Overview
Once per 4-month term each GAA will attend a fellow GAA's workshop, observe, then provide constructive feedback. The program is collaborative: instructor and observer will meet before the workshop to agree on areas of focus and the type of feedback desired (e.g. an instructor may request feedback about something specific they want to improve).

GAAs will observe colleagues from other Research Commons teams to expose themselves to new ideas and meet other members of the larger group. Each GAA will be an observer **and** an instructor, but they don't necessarily need to work with the same person in both roles.

GAAs in their first term in the Research Commons are still orienting to the work and will not participate in the program until their second 4-month term (Jan-Apr, May-Aug, or Sep-Dec). 

## Time commitment
The estimated time commitment is 4 to 4.5 hours per GAA per term, depending on workshop length. The time breakdown below excludes workshop delivery, which is part of normally scheduled work.

- **Introductory meeting.** 0.5 hours, observer and instructor
- **Workshop.** 1.5-2 hours, observer
- **Preparing feedback.** 0.5 hours, observer
- **Follow-up meeting (sharing feedback).** 0.5 hours, observer and instructor

GAAs are encouraged to meet in real time (face-to-face or on Zoom) for the introductory and follow-up meetings. The observation itself may happen any time in the term, but planning should be early enough to ensure everyone has the opportunity to be both observer and instructor. Team leads will help with initial pairing, but GAAs in observer and instructor roles are expected to schedule their own meetings.

## Resources

### RISE model for self-evaluation and feedback
**RISE** is an acronym for **R**eflect, **I**nquire, **S**uggest, **E**levate. The four tiers of the RISE model can guide self-evaluations and help observers provide meaningful feedback.

### Pre-observation questions
Questions that the observer may wish to ask the instructor during the introductory meeting, adapted from [CTLT Pre-Observation Questions](http://wiki.ubc.ca/images/6/6c/PRTPreObservationQsPDF_(2018_05).pdf) and University of Toronto Guide to [Peer Observation of Teaching](http://teaching.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Peer-Observation-of-Teaching-Guide.pdf).

- What is the content and structure of the workshop?
- What are the goals an objectives of the workshop?
- What would you like me to focus on during the workshop?
- What feedback would you like? Written or verbal?
- Is there anything else I should be aware of?
