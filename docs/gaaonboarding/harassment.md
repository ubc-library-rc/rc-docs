# Some notes about harassment
If you are not comfortable with how a client is speaking or behaving towards you, then:
1. Get yourself out of the situation immediately. You don't need anyone else's confirmation that you are uncomfortable. Trust your gut and get out. Any excuse to leave the room (including needing the washroom) will suffice.
2. Know that you can come and get any of us in the Research Commons (Allan, Sarah, Evan, Jeremy, Eka, Paul, Eugene). If we are all away for some reason, you can also go to the Circulation Desk (3rd Floor) or Reference Help Desk (3rd Floor).

The Library fully supports you and your right to feel comfortable in doing your work. You can read about the policies that protect all of us here:

Note: At the end of this document, many other UBC-wide policies are also quoted for your reference.

## Tips from colleagues on dealing with difficult or hostile individuals:
1. When hosting an appointment alone, take the seat closest to the door and ask your client to take the other seat. 
2. If you feel better with the door open at any point, prop it open. 
3. If something is off, loop someone else in as soon as you can. 
4. If a client is speaking to you aggressively:
* take time to respond calmly and slowly
* avoid personal apologies and other language that reinforces the notion of personal fault
* avoid over-promising or suggesting resolutions especially those that are outside of your control
* verbally acknowledge what you hear the person is experiencing frustration
* non-verbal interruption can be effective, eg. getting up and walking to the door

## Additional items to keep in mind:
* If a client is making unwanted sexual advances or pursuing you in any other manner that is making you feel uncomfortable, you can simply let them know that we reserve the right to limit the number of consults and you do not need to book further consults with this person.
* There are options for you to offer consults in busier rooms where you are not alone with clients, such as Room 218A in Koerner Library. If this is something that interests you, please just let us know.

## Anything else?
Just let us know if you have any other further concerns or want to talk about any other circumstances.
