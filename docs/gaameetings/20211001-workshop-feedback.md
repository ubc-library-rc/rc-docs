## Workshop feedback
Meeting notes from discussions at the RC GAA Team meeting - October 1, 2021. 

### Agenda

- Proposal for a new question on the workshop/consultation feedback form
- Discussion about participants’ experience of our workshops. For this part, please think about the ideal experience for an RC workshop participant: in a word or phrase, what do you hope our participants experience?

### Feedback form: changes 

- *New question on feedback form.* Team leads proposed adding a new question about other topics participants would like the RC to support. There was some discussion about question wording and scope, and general agreement that it would be helpful. After the meeting, GAA team leads and Eugene settled on the following new question: “Is there a topic or subject you’d like us to support? Please describe.” (Added to the form October 8.)

- *Likert-scale question(s) about workshop.* Some GAAs suggested adding likert-scale questions about aspects of the workshop (e.g. pacing, participant satisfaction, etc.). Team leads and Eugene discussed this after the meeting and decided to keep the survey short and to emphasize open-ended questions that encourage patrons to provide specific comments and suggestions. For workshops we will ask participants to complete the form during the workshop. We expect this to increase the number of responses; next Term we’ll discuss whether there are still gaps in the kind of information we’re receiving from participants.

- *Feedback form URL.* Jeremy posted information about creating workshop/consult-specific links for feedback. See <https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/rc-docs/docs/usingthercspaces/feedback-survey.html> 

### Participant experience 

 GAAs were asked to think about the ideal experience for an RC workshop participant: in a word or phrase, what do you hope our participants experience? 

- empowered
- the workshop should inspire them to learn on their own
- leaving the workshop with enough knowledge to start using the software
- not confused, ready to work
- knowledgeable
- engaging
- informative
- inspired
- excited
- equipped
- included

Teams are encouraged to continue this discussion in their smaller team meetings. With this list in mind, how can we change or enhance our workshops?
