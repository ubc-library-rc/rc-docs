**Crediting GAA work:**
- Research Commons document: https://ubcca.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/ubcLBRY-gr-UBCLibraryResearchCommons/EX-j_LFCuNVLk4gOPye2evoBTM8Zf72TMeczq7fqecB_cg?e=u5O3ZS
- Pertains to workshop and Open Educational Resources (OERs) contributions
- Two related, but differentiated concepts:
    - Copyright
        - Pertains to ownership rights of the work (intellectual property)
        - Work done by paid employees of UBC is the property of the university
    - Attribution
        - Giving credit to the creators of a work
        - Attribution: contribution of, at least, 10% of a work
- Research Commons' planned approach is to display attribution in three locations on GitHub:
    - README file
    - Acknowledgements page
    - Landing page (optional)
- Goal is to create different entry points for different audiences
- Gray areas exist around copyright if work is carried on past your time as a student
- Check-in: Does this meet your needs?
- Attribution facilitates the process of editing/changing existing material
    - Lily contacted former GAA to discuss altering workshop material
- No further comments from GAAs
    - Team Leads will proceed with current approach<br><br>

**Teaching strategies (reflection/discussion):**
- Mentioning (and repeating) consultations in workshops often leads to improved uptake
- Allow time for audience to catchup
- Teaching provides an opportunity to learn new things
- Sharing workshop recordings with participants (i.e., knowing they can refer to it later) can help participants focus on what the instructor is doing
- During consultations, participants often arrive with a great deal of anxiety, as they feel they must absorb all the information in a single session (1 hour)
    - Letting them know they can focus on the same material in another consultation can put their mind at ease, and allow them to concentrate better
- Workshop feedback from participants is helpful in improving teaching
    - Incorporating a link into a workshop often improves the quantity of feedback received
- In-person repetition of a workshop provides the experience to forsee and preempt potential issues
- For future consideration: having students share screen with instructor, but not other participants
    - Goal: To assist with technical troubleshooting, as well as to gauge the capacity of the audience to follow along
- In-person vs. online workshops
    - Most teams offering online workshops
    - Some in-person offerings saw as little as 10% of registrants actually attend
    - Online attendance has been closer to 50% of registrants
    - Online offerings may also allow us to catch people who might not otherwise come into the physical library building
    - Some Team Leads have found that offering hybrid workshops results in no in-person attendees
    - Recommendation to offer in-person and online, but to avoid hybrid
    - In-person workshops can be useful in resolving technical issues, as well as helping the instructor gauge audience engagement
    - Online workshops can be useful during the summer, as many people are off campus
        - Though, early summer can see high demand for in-person workshops from faculty (e.g., for summer DS projects)
- GAAs can sign-up for free instructional training through UBC's Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Technology at https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/instructional-skills-workshops/.<br><br>
