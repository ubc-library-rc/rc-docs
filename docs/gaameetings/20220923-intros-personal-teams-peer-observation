required for non-new GAAs, new GAAs can participate if you'd like, inform team leads
peer-observation sign-up spreadsheet, place name in 'Observer' column
sooner enter, more options you will have
connecting with another GAA: encourage finding someone from another team, will be discussing instruction within team
good to discuss form of feedback, conversation about if they're looking for specific feedback
Reza: attended NVivo workshop by Amir and Jeremy, selected to know more about topic
team leads will coordinate sign-up, likely via email
Keith: leave till next term for Bamidele, Scott

#### Advice from continuing GAAs to newcomers (Reza and Lily)

**Lily**: one on one consults, lead workshops, project on creating spatial index, enjoying flexibility of different tasks, work-learn position, talk to supervisor about what you'd like to get out of it

**Reza**: great opportunity to practice presentation skills, flexibility, learn from your own mistakes (e.g. not working with certain OS), continuous updating of workshops, consultations: don't be afraid to say you don't know

**Angela**: work very helpful to library, will live on for some time, open to feedback on how things might be improved

#### Roundtable question: What is something you hope to learn or a skill you would like to develop during your work at the Research Commons? (everyone)

**Bamidele**: interested in data, metadata, interested in opportunities
**eugene**: @Bamidele - a good place to start could be learning some markdown language

**Scott**: developing instructional skills, keeping people engaged

**Keith**: opportunities for instruction during informational sessions

**Angela**: always welcomed to attend each others' workshops

**Ashley**: instructional skills, lots of classroom observations, but few opportunities to teach myself, stay connected with people

**Jess**: For people interested in instruction: I found the Instructional Skills Workshop (ISW) at UBC to be helpful when I was a grad student: https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/instructional-skills-workshops/

**Reza**: working to adjust my pace, every session is different

**Lily**: commuting at the moment:( but one thing I want to learn more about is what jobs for GIS and map-ers there are in libraries, and what a skillset for that kind of work is

**Angela**: Will have Evan respond

**Jeremy**: don't be shy about suggesting new workshop topics and projects

**Angela**: schedule 3 gaa meetings per term, sep, dec, apr
