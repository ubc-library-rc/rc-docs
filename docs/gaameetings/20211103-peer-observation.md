## Peer observation
Meeting notes from discussions at the RC GAA Team meeting - November 3, 2021. 

### Agenda

- Announcements
- Review of outcomes from previous meeting:
	- new question on feedback form
	- information about creating event-specific feedback URLs (see <https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/rc-docs/docs/usingthercspaces/feedback-survey.html>) 
- Discussion: peer observation program

### Observations about current activities 

- Most GAA teams are observing a decrease in workshop attendance (except NVivo)
- Also a decrease in consultations
- Some discussion about Zoom/online fatigue as a factor 

### Discussion: peer observation program

- Jeremy described what a Research Commons peer observation program might look like. The purpose is twofold: 1) to provide structured opportunities for GAA instructors to see and learn from how others deliver RC workshops; and 2) to ensure instructors receive supportive, constructive feedback so they can strengthen their instruction and workshop development skills.

- Eka introduced related resources available through CTLT's [Instructional Skills Workshop (ISW)](https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/instructional-skills-workshops/). The ISW provides sample feedback forms and models for peer review and self-evaluation that we may wish to adapt for the peer observation program.
	- [RISE model for self-evaluation](ISW_docs/RISE_infographic-self-web.pdf)
	- [RISE model for meaninful feedback](ISW_docs/RISE_rubric-peer-web.pdf)
	- [Unstructured feedback form](ISW_docs/Unstructured_feedback_form.docx)
	- [Semi-structured_feedback form](ISW_docs/Semi-structured_feedback_form.docx)
	- [Structured feedback form](ISW_docs/Structured_feedback_form.docx)

- Several GAAs expressed interest in and excitement about a peer observation program

- Tomoko noted that UBC Okanagan Library has a peer observation program with instructions and documentation we may wish to use (bottom of page at <https://confluence.it.ubc.ca/display/COMMITTEES/Help+Centre>, CWL login)

- Several people also noted the importance of a pre-observation meeting between the person providing feedback and the instructor. This is an opportunity for the two to agree on what the observer will provide feedback on, in what format, etc. (important to develop trust and avoid crossing boundaries). 

- Feedback already happens within teams, and some teams use GitHub Issues to keep track of suggestions and improve workshop. This in-team feedback is valuable and should continue alongside the broader peer observation program. 

- **Action:** peer observation program expected to start in January 2022, with each GAA observing (and being observed) one time per academic term on an ongoing basis. RC Team leads will work out the details and ensure teams have the information they need.
